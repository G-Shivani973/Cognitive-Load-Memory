# Cognitive-Load-Memory
 A machine learning project analyzing cognitive load levels using survey data. Includes data preprocessing, visualization, and model evaluation.
## Overivew
Survey responses are used in the study to analyze degree of cognitive burden. The dataset is made up of questionnaire answers that are used to predict cognitive load levels through machine learning methods. For deeper insights, visualization tools including confusion matrices, feature significance plots, and histograms are employed.
## Dataset Overview
> Entries: 143
> Columns: 8
> Datatypes:
>      Timestamp (datetime)
>      Score & Rate (int)
>      Other columns (object / text)
## Results
> A histogram to show the distribution of cogntive strain
> The significance of features for forecasting
> Confusion matrix for assessing the performance of the model
